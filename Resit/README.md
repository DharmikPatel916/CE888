## Classification of Covid-19 patient data with non covid-19 using Neural Network

#### The corona virus, covid-19, has a wide range of effects on human existence in the year 2019-20.
Detecting the virus in its early stages is quite challenging. We used multi-class categorization
to do this. This research revealed amethod for automatically detecting this disease that makes
efficient use of Deep CNN.With a classification accuracy of 91, the neural network is the most
accurate.
