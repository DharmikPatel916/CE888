##  This notebook is an implementation of the work shown in the paper :



***Using Regression to predict Forest Fires ::*** 
This is a regression task, where the aim is to predict 
the burned area of forest fires, by using machine learning algorithms. 
Collected from [UCI ML repository]
***Original dataset :***
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/forest-fires/
***A comparision of four methods has been done ::***

* ***Support Vector Regression***
* ***Decision Trees***
* ***Random Forest***
* ***Deepnets(Keras with tensorflow backend)***

***How to Run the Code***
* open in Google Colab / jupyter notebook
* Locate the dataset file
* Run all / run by cell
